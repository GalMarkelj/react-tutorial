## Arrays & Objects

- First you need to be comfortable working with arrays and objects before working with React. To achieve that, first, I want you to watch [Jack Herringtons series "Arrays made simple"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaJI7RkSPx8&list=PLNqp92_EXZBJmAHWnJbVnXsl71hiHCrQh&index=1), episodes from 1 to 6. Here you will learn the fundamentals of many array functions and later use them in almost every React component. With those functions you will replace the **for loop**.
- Second, you will use what you learned from the series and do an exercise made from [Andrej Cremmoznik](https://github.com/andrejcremoznik). Open the file [products-array](https://github.com/GalMarkelj/react-tutorial/blob/main/exercise-1/products-array.js) and do the tasks with the dummy data. Tasks are written in the bottom of the file. For help, I'm giving you a solution to all the tasks in file [products-array-solved](https://github.com/GalMarkelj/react-tutorial/blob/main/exercise-1/products-array-solved.js), but first, try to do it by yourself. To get the answers logged in the terminal, run `node products-array-solved.js` in the root directory.
