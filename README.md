# Beginner React tutorial

By following this tutorial step by step to the end you will give me a chance to teach you basics of react. You'll be able to use this on every react project that you will be working on. To follow this course you need zero knowledge about react, but it is useful to know some JavaScript.


## Why follow my tutorial?

There is a lot of courses, content and documentation from great developers, but, if you are starting I'm sure that you don't know where to start. Like, which course to take, how much should you pay for a quality course, is the documentation that you will be reading even useful and so on. My journey whiting react started like that. Luckily I have a great mentor [Andrej Cremoznik](https://github.com/andrejcremoznik), that guided me trough that and answer me all the questions that were not answered in some courses and documentation. In this tutorial I will try to follow his steps and try to teach you like he did me. If you will have any questions, I will answer them as soon as I can with quality answers.


## What will you learn

* how to work with arrays and objects,
* how to set up react with VITE,
* basics of react,
* usage of react query,
* usage of react router

**IMPORTANT**: I will not provide all the content in this tutorial. Mostly, I will guide you trough the documentation, courses, videos by giving you tasks and you will need to read that by yourself to really get everything under your skin.

## Get started

To start this tutorial you will need to have a code editor and preferably your own reposetory where you will save all your work. The purpose of the reposetory is that you can continue the tutorial by yourself, to give me an option to rewview your work, for you to give me questions.
